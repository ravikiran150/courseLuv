1. Introduction:

    The Payslip web application aims to streamline the process of providing monthly payslips to employees in small companies. The application offers a simple and efficient login feature, requiring minimal setup. Instead of manually preparing payslips using spreadsheets, employees can conveniently access and download their monthly payslips through the application.

2. Objective:

    The primary objective of the Payslip Project is to eliminate the manual effort involved in creating and distributing monthly payslips in small companies. The application aims to provide employees with a user-friendly platform for easily accessing and downloading their payslips on a monthly basis.

3. Application Overview:

    The Payslip web application utilizes monthly salary statements generated by the company's accounting department for salary processing. The application streamlines the process by allowing account personnel to upload or input the salary data into the system. The application then processes this data to generate individual payslips for each employee.

4. Lifecycle of Application:

    - Upload or Input Salary Data: 
        Account personnel upload or input the monthly salary statement into the application.
    - Data Extraction: 
        The application extracts relevant data from the uploaded salary statement and identifies the company name.
    - Data Export: 
        Extracted data is exported to the database for further processing.
    - Payslip Generation: 
        The application generates personalized payslips for each employee based on the exported data.

5. Challenges:

The project poses the following challenges:

    - Custom Payslip Formats: 
        Providing different payslip formats for various companies.
    - Company Differentiation: 
    Differentiating between companies from the uploaded salary statement.

6. Solution Approach:

    - Custom Payslip Formats: 
        Implement a template-based system that allows customization of payslip formats by the company. Companies can upload their own payslip templates.
    - Company Differentiation: 
        Use a company identifier within the salary statement to accurately identify and categorize different companies.

7. Features and Functionality:

    1. User authentication and role-based access.
    2. Salary statement upload and data extraction.
    3. Customizable payslip templates.
    4. Employee dashboard to view and download payslips.
    5. Admin panel for managing companies, templates, and user roles.

8. Technology Stack:

    1. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
    2. Backend: Node.js, Express.js
    3. Database: MySQL
    4. Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
    5. Data Storage: Amazon S3 (for uploaded files)

9. Implementation Steps:

    1. Design database schema.
    2. Develop user authentication and authorization.
    3. Implement salary statement upload functionality.
    4. Create data extraction and processing logic.
    5. Allow customization of payslip templates.
    6. Develop employee dashboard and admin panel.
    7. Integrate Amazon S3 for file storage.
    8. Implement company differentiation based on identifiers.

10. User Roles and Permissions:

    1. Employee: Can view and download their own payslips.
    2. Admin: Manages companies, templates, and user roles.
    3. Account Personnel: Uploads salary statements and manages data.

11. Security Measures:

    1. Data encryption during transmission and storage.
    2. Secure authentication using JWT.
    3. Role-based access control to prevent unauthorized access.

12. Testing Strategy:

    1. Unit testing for individual components.
    2. Integration testing for user flows.
    3. User acceptance testing with stakeholders.

13. Future Enhancements:

    1. Integration with payroll processing systems.
    2. Automated email notifications for payslip availability.
    3. Enhanced data analytics and reporting.
    4. 4Mobile app for on-the-go access.

14. Conclusion:

    The Payslip Project aims to revolutionize the way small companies handle monthly payslip distribution. By automating the process and providing an intuitive user interface, the application brings efficiency and convenience to both employees and administrators.
